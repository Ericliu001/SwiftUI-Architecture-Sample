/**
 * A utility class that provides lazy instantiation with weak reference management.
 * 
 * This class is designed to prevent retain cycles in parent-child scope relationships
 * while maintaining lazy initialization semantics. It holds a weak reference to the
 * created object and can recreate it using the provided closure if needed.
 *
 * Usage in scope architecture:
 * ```swift
 * lazy var childScope: Weak<ChildScope> = Weak({ ChildScope(parent: self) })
 * ```
 *
 * Access the wrapped object via the `value` property:
 * ```swift
 * childScope.value.someMethod()
 * ```

     *                      or when the weakly-held instance has been deallocated.
